### Why Ark.NET
Ark.NET is the ARK Ecosystem library for the .NET platform. It implements all most relevant ARK functionalities to help you  **develop efficient .NET applications built upon ARK platform**. It provides also low level access to ARK so you can easily build your application on top of it. 

The package supports:
* With full features, Windows Desktop applications, Mono Desktop applications, and platform supported at [.NET Standard Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/standard/library). Should work will all .NET solutions with framework > 4.5.2.
* It's a work in progress so mobile platform testing are still to follow.

>**Install-Package ark.net** 
Go on the [nuget website](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ark.net/) for more information.

### From source:
To compile it by yourself, you can git clone, open the project and hit the compile button on visual studio.
In command prompt:
```
git clone https://github.com/kristjank/ark-net
cd ark-net
```
# How to get started? 

All ark-node services have available reponses have their object representations in the form of ValueObjects. You can use service classes under [service folder](https://github.com/kristjank/ark-net/tree/master/ark-net/service). Responses are IEnumerable or IQueryable (depends if the class and functionality).

It's best to let the code do the speaking. For more examples look at the [ARK.NET Tests](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-net/tree/master/ark-netTests), where all tests are written and you can see the api usage. Some code snippets are below.


### Ark.Net Client init
**First call should be network selection, so all settings can initialize before going into action.**

```c#
  ArkNetApi.Instance.Start(NetworkType.MainNet); //Other types are TestNet and DevNet
```
For **additional settings** please see [settings file](https://github.com/kristjank/ark-net/blob/master/ark-net/default.conf#L9). To **modify** settings, just add settings.conf file to root folder. File can only include changed settings (not all).

### Account/Wallet layer
```c#
var accCtnrl = new AccountController("top secret pass");
//Send ARK
var result = accCtnrl.SendArk(100, "AUgTuukcKeE4XFdzaK6rEHMD5FLmVBSmHk", "Akr.Net test trans from Account",
                "pass phrase");
//Vote 4 Delegate                
var result = accCtnrl.VoteForDelegate( votes, "top secret pass");
```

### Service layer 
For a full list of available api calls please look at the  [ARK.NET Test project](https://github.com/kristjank/ark-net/blob/master/ark-netTests/)
```c#
//PeerService
var peers = PeerService.GetAll();
var peersOK = peers.Where(x => x.Status.Equals("OK"));

//TransactionService
var trans = TransactionService.GetAll();
...
```
### Core Layer 
Layer is used for core Ark blockchain communication (transaction, crypto...). It is wrapped by api libraries that are called from the service and Account layer.
```c#
TransactionApi tx = TransactionApi.CreateTransaction(recepient, amount, description, passphrase);
Peer peer = Network.Mainnet.GetRandomPeer();
var result = peer.PostTransaction(tx);          
```
